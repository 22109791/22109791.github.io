<h3>About Unit 1 </h3>
This is the unit 1 page (The Online World). Unit 1 the Online World is about how do computers work? How do emails reach your computer? As well as how does the use of computer applications affect your daily life? The work on unit 1 required me to explore a range of digital devices,such as smart phones and digital music players and considering the technology that enables these devices to share and exchange information. This work required me to complete google classroom work as well online revision for a test on the unit. some of the topics this unit covered were online services, online documents, online communication and data storage. I completed the Unit 1 test with a level 2 pass grade.
